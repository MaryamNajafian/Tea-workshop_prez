    "* Learning rate: The size of these steps is called the learning rate. With a high learning rate we can cover more ground each step, but we risk overshooting the lowest point since the slope of the hill is constantly changing. With a very low learning rate, we can confidently move in the direction of the negative gradient since we are recalculating it so frequently. A low learning rate is more precise, but calculating the gradient is time-consuming, so it will take us a very long time to get to the bottom.\n",

    "## Linear Regression\n",
    " It finds line of best fit. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm where the predicted output is continuous and has a constant slope. It’s used to predict values within a continuous range, (e.g. sales, price) rather than trying to classify them into categories (e.g. cat, dog). There are two main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Simple regression`: Simple linear regression uses traditional slope-intercept form, where $m$ and $𝑏$ are the variables our algorithm will try to “learn” to produce the most accurate predictions. $𝑥$ represents our input data and $𝑦$ represents our prediction. $y = mx + b$\n",
    "    * Step-by-step Now if we run gradient descent using a cost function. There are two parameters in our cost function we can control: $𝑚$ (weight) and $𝑏$ (bias). Since we need to consider the impact each one has on the final prediction, we need to use partial derivatives. We calculate the partial derivatives of the cost function with respect to each parameter and store the results in a gradient.\n",
    "    $𝑓(𝑚,𝑏)= 1/N * sum (𝑦_𝑖−(𝑚*𝑥_𝑖+𝑏))^2 for i in [1,n]$\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Multivariable regression`: A more complex, multi-variable linear equation might look like this, where 𝑤 represents the coefficients, or weights, our model will try to learn. $ 𝑓(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧)=𝑤1𝑥+𝑤2𝑦+𝑤3𝑧$\n",
    "    * The variables $𝑥,𝑦,𝑧$ represent the attributes, or distinct pieces of information, we have about each observation. For sales predictions, these attributes might include a company’s advertising spend on radio, TV, and newspapers.  $𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠=𝑤1𝑅𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑜+𝑤2𝑇𝑉+𝑤3𝑁𝑒𝑤𝑠$\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Cost function`: We need a cost function so we can start optimizing our weights.\n",
    "    * Let’s use MSE (L2) as our cost function. MSE measures the average squared difference between an observation’s actual and predicted values. The output is a single number representing the cost, or score, associated with our current set of weights. Our goal is to minimize MSE to improve the accuracy of our model.\n",
    "    * Given our simple linear equation $𝑦=𝑚𝑥+𝑏$, we can calculate MSE as: $ 𝑀𝑆𝐸 = 1/𝑁 * sum(𝑦𝑖−(𝑚𝑥𝑖+𝑏))^2 for i in [1,n]$\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Normalization`: As the number of features grows, calculating gradient takes longer to compute.\n",
    "We can speed this up by “normalizing” our input data to ensure all values are within the same range.\n",
    "This is especially important for datasets with high standard deviations or differences in the ranges of the attributes.\n",
    " Our goal now will be to normalize our features so they are all in the range -1 to 1.\n",

    "      - L1 regularization: accomplishes this by choosing the most important features by forcing some weights to be zero\n",
    "            It encourages a sparse solution, forces weights to be zero (few non-zero w)\n",
    "      - L2 regularization: accomplishes this by making the assertion that none of the weights are extremely large\n",
    "            It encourages small weights ( all w values close to 0 not exactly 0) \n",
    "      - L2 penalty is `quadratic` and L1 is an `absolute` function\n",
    "        -In Quadratic as w->0, derivative -> 0: if w is already small, further gradient descent won't change much\n",

    "      - Elasticnet regularizattion: It's possible to include both L1 and L2 simultaneously (`Elasticnet`)\n",
    "      - regularization reduces over fitting, because as Lambda gets bigger our weights get smaller and in cases like Tanh or Sigmoid g(z)=tanh(z) or sigmoid(z) becomes almost linear around zero z_l = (w_l . a_l-1) + b,\n",
    "      - so if lambda is big, then weights and consequently z are forced to be small, activation functions around 0 act like a linear function, and if every layer acts linear then the whole network acts like a linear model\n",

    "            - L1 is more robust and resistant to outliers in data compared to L2. It lets outliers be safely ignored unlike the L2 loss that adjust the model for outliers in expense of many common examples, since L2 squares the error, the model will see a much larger error than the L1, so the model is much more sensitive to outliers\n",
    "        - L2-norm loss function ( least squares error) is not very robust , gives you stable solution, and always one solution\n",
    "            - S = sum((y_i - y_i_hat)^2) for i in [1:n]\n",
    "            - Unlike L1, the L2 loss is stable, because for any small adjustment of a data point the regressionline moves only slightly\n",

    "              we might be able to avoid the exploding weights by making the variance smaller by\n",
    "              initializing weights w to have mean 0 and variance 1/D as: `w = np.random.randn(D) / np.sqrt(D)`\n",

    "              therefore if we want the `var(y)=1`, we must have `var(w) = 1/D` and hence `sd(w)=1/sqrt(D)`\n",

    "    - Normalizing the training set leads to faster training.\n",

    "    - if you don't normalize your data the cost function looks very elongated because corresponding parameters to features of different range will be proportionaly different\n",

    "        * Doing the inverted dropout (besides not having to change the code at test time) is that during training one can get fancy and change the dropout rate dynamically. This has been termed as \"annealed\" dropout. Essentially the logic is that adding dropout \"noise\" towards the beginning of training helps to keep the optimization from getting stuck in a local minimum, while letting it decay to zero in the end results in a finer tuned network with better performance.\n",
    "    * `Early Stopping`: One of the biggest problem in training neural network is how long to train the model.\n",
    "        * During the training you want to optimize your cost function but also not overfitting, early stopping forces the system not to overfit and stops the training before the cost is fully optimized\n",
    "        * Training too little will lead to underfit in train and test sets. Training too much will have the overfit in training set and poor result in test sets.\n",
    "        * Here the challenge is to train the network long enough that it is capable of learning the mapping from inputs to outputs, but not training the model so long that it overfits the training data.\n",
    "        * One possible solution to solve this problem is to treat the number of training epochs as a hyperparameter and train the model multiple times with different values, then select the number of epochs that result in the best accuracy on the train or a holdout test dataset, But the problem is it requires multiple models to be trained and discarded.\n",

This process is called Early stopping.\n",

    "    * `Injecting Noise`: Noise is often introduced to the inputs as a dataset augmentation strategy. When we have a small dataset the network may effectively memorize the training dataset. Instead of learning a general mapping from inputs to outputs, the model may learn the specific input examples and their associated outputs. One approach for improving generalization error and improving the structure of the mapping problem is to add random noise.\n",
    "        * Adding noise means that the network is less able to memorize training samples because they are changing all of the time, resulting in smaller network weights and a more robust network that has lower generalization error.\n",

    "            * Noise Injection on Weights: Noise added to weights can be interpreted as a more traditional form of regularization. In other words, it pushes the model to be relatively insensitive to small variations in the weights, finding points that are not merely minima, but minima surrounded by flat regions.\n",
    "            * Noise Injection on Outputs: In the real world dataset, We can expect some amount of mistakes in the output labels. One way to remedy this is to explicitly model the noise on labels. An example for Noise Injection on Outputs is label smoothing\n",

We use the cost function to update our parameters. Our cost function can take a variety of forms as there are many different cost functions available. Popular loss functions include: MSE (L2) and Cross-entropy Loss.\n",
    "    * Cross-Entropy: Cross-entropy loss, or log loss, measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1. Cross-entropy loss increases as the predicted probability diverges from the actual label. So predicting a probability of .012 when the actual observation label is 1 would be bad and result in a high loss value. A perfect model would have a log loss of 0\n",
    "        * As the predicted probability approaches 1, log loss slowly decreases. As the predicted probability decreases, however, the log loss increases rapidly. Log loss penalizes both types of errors, but especially those predictions that are confident and wrong!\n",

    "This is used to enable using large batch sizes that require more GPU memory than available. Gradient accumulation helps in doing so by using mini-batches that require an amount of GPU memory that can be satisfied.\n",
    "Gradient accumulation means running all mini-batches sequentially (generally on the same GPU) while accumulating their calculated gradients and not updating the model variables - the weights and biases of the model.

Only after accumulating the gradients of all those mini-batches will we generate and apply the updates for the model variables.\n",
